# DataStructure
This repository is for personal practice on data structures using nodejs. 
All suggestions and improvements are welcome .
Topic/Questions that are covered in thi repo are as follows:
## Arrays and strings
  - Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
  - Given two strings , write a method to decide if one is a permutation of another
  - Given a string , write an algo to check if is a permutation of a palindrome. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
  - There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings :insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings write a       function to check if they are one edit away.
